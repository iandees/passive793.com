      <h2>Thanks For Stopping By!</h2>
      <p>We are Kyle and Ian, and we have lived in this location since 2018. After getting frustrated by the draftiness and cold floors of our home built in 1892 during the long, cold winters of 2020 and 2021, we started the project to build a new passive house here in 2022. Construction began in November 2023, and we moved into our new home in November 2024.</p>

      <h2>What is a Passive House?</h2>
      <p><a href="https://passivehouseminnesota.org/learn/passive-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Passive House</em></a> is a rigorous, voluntary standard for energy efficiency in buildings, which reduces the building's energy and ecological footprint. It results in buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. Passive House is a step beyond the Energy Star or LEED certifications that you might have already heard about.</p>

      <p class="info-callout">Our home was designed and built to meet the extra strict Passive House Plus certification standard, meaning it produces (via rooftop solar) all the energy it uses over the course of a year.</p>

      <h2>Key Features of Our Passive House</h2>

      <h3>Double-Wall Construction</h3>
      <p>The house features double-wall construction that reduces thermal bridging and creates space for additional insulation, enhancing the thermal envelope of the building. Exterior walls are built using 2x8 timber, followed by an air and moisture barrier, followed by a 10" cavity built from I-joists. Finally, the outer cladding is a durable, very low maintenance metal siding.</p>

      <h3>Extra Thick Insulation</h3>
      <p>Our walls are 18 inches thick and have dense-pack cellulose insulation blown into them, giving an insulation value of approximately R-60. This is significantly more insulation than conventional homes, which typically have R-17. This extra insulation dramatically reduces heat transfer and maintains comfortable temperatures year-round with minimal energy input.</p>

      <p>While there is no attic, we do have room for 20 inches of dense-packed cellulose insulation below the roof, giving us roughly R-70 of insulation at the top. Similarly, the foundation walls are made using 6 inch insulated concrete forms (ICF) with an additional 6 inches of foam wrapping that. Our concrete slab has more than 10 inches of foam beneath it, too.</p>

      <h3>Air Tightness</h3>
      <p>The house has been meticulously sealed and tested to prevent air leakage, eliminating drafts and ensuring the ventilation system works efficiently to maintain excellent indoor air quality. Modern code-built homes are required to have an ACH50 (air changes per hour at 50 pascals) of less than 3.0. Our home was tested to 0.6 ACH50.</p>

      <h3>Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV)</h3>
      <p>A very airtight home still needs to get fresh air from outside. To do this, our home uses an ERV to continuously exchange indoor and outdoor air while recovering heat (or cold) from the exhaust air. A ground-coupled coolant loop in the side yard pre-conditions incoming air, further reducing heating and cooling demands. This system also acts as our shower exhaust fan, automatically boosting to remove the extra moisture when we take a shower or cook a meal.</p>

      <h3>High-Performance Windows</h3>
      <p>Our large, south-facing triple-glazed windows are designed to maximize solar heat gain in winter while external shades prevent overheating in summer, providing natural light and passive solar heating. The windows are built using special components that reduce thermal bridging between the inside conditioned space and outside. Our high performance windows have triple gaskets that seal on all four sides but can still open using a tilt and turn mechanism, allowing us to get a great breeze when its nice outside.</p>

      <h3>Automated Exterior Shades</h3>
      <p>Our home features exterior shades that work with the Loxone smart home system to automatically regulate indoor temperature. When room temperature reaches 72Â°F, the system closes the shades to prevent overheating. Throughout the day, the shades automatically adjust to block direct sunlight while still allowing natural light to enter, maintaining comfort without sacrificing daylight.</p>

      <h2>Sustainable Systems</h2>

      <h3>All-Electric Home</h3>
      <p>Our home uses no fossil fuels, relying instead on clean electricity. This makes it more environmentally friendly and future-proof as the grid gets greener.</p>

      <h3>Air Source Heat Pump</h3>
      <p>Space heating is provided by a highly efficient air source heat pump that extracts heat from the outside air, even in cold temperatures, using much less energy than conventional heating systems.</p>

      <h3>Heat Pump Water Heater</h3>
      <p>Domestic hot water is produced by a heat pump water heater, which is up to three times more efficient than traditional electric water heaters. On hot days, the hot water heater will turn on to help cool the inside of the house and act as a thermal battery, storing heat for use later on.</p>

      <h3>Induction Cooktop</h3>
      <p>Our kitchen features a high-efficiency induction cooktop that provides precise temperature control while using significantly less energy than gas or traditional electric ranges. Induction cooking is also safer, with no open flames or hot elements.</p>

      <h3>Rooftop Solar PV System</h3>
      <p>The photovoltaic array on our roof generates 8 kilowatts of clean electricity to power our home. This solar system significantly reduces our carbon footprint and is designed to offset our energy consumption throughout the year, making the house a "net-zero" building.</p>

    <section class="landscaping-section">
      <h3>Bee-Friendly Lawn</h3>
      <p>Instead of a traditional grass lawn, we've planted a diverse mix of low-growing flowering plants that provide essential habitat and food for pollinators, especially bees. This helps support local biodiversity while creating a beautiful, colorful landscape.</p>

      <h3>No-Mow Landscaping</h3>
      <p>Our low-maintenance landscaping design eliminates the need for regular mowing, reducing noise pollution and carbon emissions from gas-powered equipment. Native plants and ground covers are used throughout, requiring minimal water and care once established.</p>

      <h2>What is a Passive House?</h2>
      <p>A passive house is a rigorous, voluntary standard for energy efficiency in buildings, which reduces the building's ecological footprint. It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling.</p>

      <div class="info-callout">
        <p>Our home was designed and built to meet the strict Passive House certification standards, making it one of the most energy-efficient and comfortable homes in the area.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="features-section">
      <h2>Key Features of Our Passive House</h2>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Extra Thick Insulation</h3>
        <p>Our walls contain significantly more insulation than conventional homes, preventing heat transfer and maintaining comfortable temperatures year-round with minimal energy input.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Double-Wall Construction</h3>
        <p>The house features double-wall construction that eliminates thermal bridging and creates space for additional insulation, enhancing the thermal envelope of the building.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV)</h3>
        <p>Our ERV system continuously exchanges indoor and outdoor air while recovering heat or coolness from the exhaust air. A ground-coupled coolant loop pre-conditions incoming air, further reducing heating and cooling demands.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Air Tightness</h3>
        <p>The house has been meticulously sealed and tested to prevent air leakage, eliminating drafts and ensuring the ventilation system works efficiently to maintain excellent indoor air quality.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>High-Performance Windows</h3>
        <p>Our large, south-facing triple-glazed windows are designed to maximize solar gain in winter while external shades prevent overheating in summer, providing natural light and passive solar heating.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Automated Exterior Shades</h3>
        <p>Our home features intelligent exterior shades that work with the Loxone smart home system to automatically regulate indoor temperature. When room temperature reaches 72°F, the system closes the shades to prevent overheating. Throughout the day, the shades automatically adjust to block direct sunlight while still allowing natural light to enter, maintaining comfort without sacrificing daylight.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="systems-section">
      <h2>Sustainable Systems</h2>

      <div class="system-card">
        <h3>All-Electric Home</h3>
        <p>Our home uses no fossil fuels, relying instead on clean electricity. This makes it more environmentally friendly and future-proof as the grid gets greener.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="system-card">
        <h3>Air Source Heat Pump</h3>
        <p>Space heating is provided by a highly efficient air source heat pump that extracts heat from the outside air, even in cold temperatures, using much less energy than conventional heating systems.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="system-card">
        <h3>Heat Pump Water Heater</h3>
        <p>Domestic hot water is produced by a heat pump water heater, which is up to three times more efficient than traditional electric water heaters.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="system-card">
        <h3>Loxone Smart Home System</h3>
        <p>Our integrated smart home system helps manage energy consumption, comfort, and lighting throughout the house, optimizing energy use while maintaining ideal living conditions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="system-card">
        <h3>Induction Cooktop</h3>
        <p>Our kitchen features a high-efficiency induction cooktop that provides precise temperature control while using significantly less energy than gas or traditional electric ranges. Induction cooking is also safer, with no open flames or hot elements.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="system-card">
        <h3>Rooftop Solar PV System (7kW)</h3>
        <p>The 7 kilowatt photovoltaic array on our roof generates clean electricity to power our home. This solar system significantly reduces our carbon footprint and helps offset our energy consumption throughout the year.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="landscaping-section">
      <h2>Eco-Friendly Landscaping</h2>
      <p>Our approach to landscaping extends the sustainable principles of our home to the surrounding property.</p>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Bee-Friendly Lawn</h3>
        <p>Instead of a traditional grass lawn, we've planted a diverse mix of low-growing flowering plants that provide essential habitat and food for pollinators, especially bees. This helps support local biodiversity while creating a beautiful, colorful landscape.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>No-Mow Landscaping</h3>
        <p>Our low-maintenance landscaping design eliminates the need for regular mowing, reducing noise pollution and carbon emissions from gas-powered equipment. Native plants and ground covers are used throughout, requiring minimal water and care once established.</p>
      </div>
